I'm an experienced IT engineer and manager with more than 18 years of 
professional experience. I'm really good at breaking down ideas into 
small tasks, coordinating development efforts on technical level, 
planning systems architecture and troubleshooting any issues that might arise.


I have strong Linux background. 
I started my career back in 2000, managing Linux-based network and systems 
for a small local ISP (Internet Services Provider). I also wrote a few 
technical articles to Linux magazine "Linux Plus".
I'm also a former president of local Szczecin Linux/Unix Users' Group. 


During my career, I also gathered experience in requirements analysis, 
IT project management (both software and infrastructure), 
software development, cryptography, Linux administration and DevOps. 
I'm putting much effort trying to look at my work from users' perspective.

I've founded my consulting business, Software Inn, to help my customers 
build and deploy complex IT solutions.

I've also built a specialized Openstack team, Manago.Cloud. We develop, 
deploy, tune, and adapt Openstack to our clients' needs. 
See our website manago.cloud for more details.

We have a registered European Union-based company and can issue 
EU VAT invoices for my services, provide you with support and 
maintenance for your infrastructure, and offer you professional, 
high-performance hosting of delivered solution.
